    <p>First some history - in fact this post is almost all history and setting the
scene for what we did later.</p>
<p>When I joined the theatre there was a website - however it had been done by
someone&rsquo;s friend, and was a flash only movie containing information on the
shows that were coming in the near future.  This suffered massively from being
done in spare time and could take months to get updated, so something had to
be done.</p>
<p>The first aim was to get a website that we could get event information onto
with as little ongoing maintenance as I could get away with.   Unfortunatly
the event information we did have was in Excel spreadsheets - and this was
arranged in colour coded tabular form (one column per month, one cell per day)
which was likely to be hard to parse automagically.</p>
<p>I decided the easiest way to handle the event information was to use an Excel
spreadsheet - this would allow other members of the theatre technical team to
update the events too.  Each event (which can cover several performance dates)
had a single line, with several fields describing it.</p>
<p>A piece of perl (yup, we have finally got there), parsed out the events
(<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Spreadsheet::ParseExcel">Spreadsheet::ParseExcel</a>)
and built a set of per-month event pages as well as a front page with current
events on it - using
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::Template">HTML::Template</a>.</p>
<p>The page generation was done off-line and the generated html pushed to the
webserver - at that time we had to take this approach as the web server was
separate to the machines with the appropriate tools to generate stuff.</p>
<p>As a fairly quick and dirty hack this worked extremely well - so much so that
it stayed in place for more than 18 months - you can see examples of this on
the way back machine - ie this one from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050309090453/http://www.jrtheatre.co.uk/">March
2004</a>. 
Meanwhile we were starting to wake up to the idea of having an events database</p>
<ul>
<li>even one as primative as the one we had - and realising we could start to
use this for our internal backstage management.</li>
</ul>
<p>We had started to use a wiki for much of the backstage management - we have
half a dozen stage managers plus other crew, all volunteers and organising all
of us is not an easy task.  The wiki chosen was <a href="http://moinmo.in/">MoinMoin</a></p>
<ul>
<li>at that time I could not see any perl wikis that I was happy with.  The wiki
contained another list of events - this time in a way more focused on periods
the theatre was booked (which is different to performance dates - it includes
rehearsals and some events that have no performances such as training events).</li>
</ul>
<p>So we were duplicating information - and I was updating a lot of that
information I felt this was very much a bad thing.</p>
<p>So I started looking at producing a proper database and bringing a lot of this
information together&hellip;.</p>
