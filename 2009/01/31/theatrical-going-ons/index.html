    <p>Currently the theatre is dark - there is 4 weeks of work being done on the heating system (conveniently in one of the colder periods).</p>
<p>A week back I did my first show of the year - a dance show with a company that I haven&rsquo;t worked with before, although thats not too suprising since they only put a show on in alternate years.  This dance school was fun to work with - well behaved, hard working and technically very good, however it was hard work because the staging aspects - lighting and set requirements - were being revealed to us as we went along.</p>
<p>However it was a good start to the year - next show is very different - Up and Under, which will be far more of a straight comedy play, but is likely to be quite creative in what they are doing.  I hope to get to one of their rehearsals in the next week or so and get an idea of whats needed.</p>
