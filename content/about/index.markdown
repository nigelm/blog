I'm a sysadmin-come-software-engineer who escaped from the world of pseudo-hardware many years back (used to do VLSI design).    I've been involved with free software for many years, with linux for more than 15, and mail systems for a similar length of time.... and I also stage manage for a local theatre, which can give an odd mix.
