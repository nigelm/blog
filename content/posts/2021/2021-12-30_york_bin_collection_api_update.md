Sometime in 2021 the API I was using to collect information on [Bin Collection
in York](/2020/04/20/york-bins-api-and-home-assistant/) stopped working, and
it took me an inordinate amount of time to get to finding out what had
happened.

It appears the API I was using was replaced by a simpler one - although the
documentation appears to say that this one has been *the one* since 2016...

So I have (finally), updated the shim I used to pull the data.

The updated shim can be found in the Github repository at [`https://github.com/nigelm/york_bin_collection`](https://github.com/nigelm/york_bin_collection)
