A gap in blogging - I have been running a show in theatre for the last week,
which leaves little time for anything else (sleep is short too).  
  
The main things learned, are never expect a stage gun to work - in fact expect
anything technical to play games given the chance...  
  
The abiding sound of the week was the click click click click bang of one of
the stagehands attempting to get a working gunshot.
