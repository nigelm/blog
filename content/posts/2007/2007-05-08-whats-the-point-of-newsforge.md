I mean, if I want to read [linux.com](http://www.linux.com/) I can go there,
so whats the point of having a site that is 95% re-publication of linux.com
content - except they only put the [first
paragraph](http://hardware.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=07/05/03/1422238) in,
and then link across to linux.com.

Annoyingly NewsForge's RSS feed appears to push stuff out faster than
linux.com's so I often see content on there before the same (but in this case
complete and original) content appears on the linux.com feed.  
  
I've solved that problem for now - NewsForge is off my feedlist.
