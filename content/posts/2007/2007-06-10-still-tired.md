So we finished the run of *How To Succeed In Business...* last night with a
pretty good performance, followed by one of the best aided get-outs I have
ever seen - we had a good sized bunch of people helping, cheerfully, get the
set out, everything cleaned up, and finally repainting the stage floor - the
stage surface is hardboard with normally a coat of graphite grey paint on it,
if someone wishes it a different colour for a show we have to return it to
normal afterwards.

The real shame is that, despite a stonking show, lots of energy and really
good staging and set, the audiences were disappointing because (we believe)
its not a well recognised show (despite being a real big one back in the
60's).

Afterwards we had a post show party - pie and peas.  And then I collapsed into
bed, and still feel fairly zomby-like today.
