I'm back in theatre again - this time to stage manage a production of [How To
Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying](http://www.theatrehistory.com/american/musical018.html).

The [bees](/2007/05/06/of-bands-and-bums/) are also back.  There were many
wandering around and dying on stage in the morning - then I found one on a
cloth I was tying up to a flying bar (it didn't like being found and stung
me).

Setting lights was a problem because the things are attracted to them when on
- my colleague also picked up a sting then.

Later we rigged an insect killer up on a flying bar near the root - it
appeared to be picking up a large number of victims.

These are supposed to be Masonry Bees - which apparently are unable to
penetrate human skin.  However several of us were stung.  Hopefully the
maintenance guys can do something about them after the weekend.
