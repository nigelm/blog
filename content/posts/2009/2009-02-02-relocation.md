I'm shunting this blog across to wordpress - mainly to be able to use some of
the tools available, such as the blogging bundle in
[TextMate](http://macromates.com/), to handle blog posts.

The main thing is that I have no intention of doing software maintenance on a
blogging platform (unless I'm being paid for it), so I am sticking with a
hosted platform.

You may also find that the theme and layout (assuming you are looking here
rather than reading via RSS) may keep changing in the short term until I get
to like one look.
