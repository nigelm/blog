I'm stage managing the musical version of _The Railway Children_ this week. 
The producing company has seen fit to obtain 4 (really!) smoke machines (_and_
a hazer).

Obviously with all this kit to play with - 2 of the smoke machines were big
brutes with DMX interfaces - we needed to test them out.  So I rigged one of
the DMX controlled ones at the front of stage, set its address, isolated the
fire alarm zones covering auditorium, stage, backstage and roof space.  The
initial test went swimmingly - and I then found that if you ran it at 10% the
machine gave a puff of smoke every few seconds with a fairly realistic train
noise.

Unforunately this smoke was coming off the front of stage and dropping
straight into the orchestra pit, and I then watched with sudden horrified
realisation as the smoke was pulled straight back into the newly installed air
recirculation system which pulls air in at the back of the orchestra pit and
then pumps it back through the heating system.  That circuit has another smoke
detector in it - on a different zone.  2 seconds later the alarms went off!!!

Lesson learned: now we need to switch off a total of 4 of the 6 zones within
the theatre whenever smoke is used on stage.
