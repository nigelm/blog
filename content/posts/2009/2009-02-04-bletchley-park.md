There has been a lot of activity on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) this morning regarding [Bletchley Park ](http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/)- the home of the wartime British decryption effort, and effectively the birthplace of modern computing.  Have a look at [http://savingbletchleypark.org/](http://savingbletchleypark.org/) for information.

Bletchley Park is decaying, and in danger of becoming unsustainable - meaning a good chunk of modern computing history will be lost to the world.  The normal funding mechanisms (National Lottery etc) have declined to support Bletchley Park.

There are many ways to support Bletchley Park - [donations](http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/changeDonate.rhtm), visiting both the [site](http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/museum.rhtm) and [The National Museum of Computing](http://www.tnmoc.org/), [petitioning the government](http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/BletchleyPark) (alternative for [non-UK folks](http://www.gopetition.co.uk/petitions/save-bletchley-park/sign.html)), or [writing to your MP](http://www.writetothem.com/) to support this to the government.

I have never visited Bletchley Park as yet (the excuse is that its too far away from the best part of the country and too close to London).  However I have donated, petitioned and this year I intend to make the visit.

How about you?
