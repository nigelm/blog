Currently the theatre is dark - there is 4 weeks of work being done on the
heating system (conveniently in one of the colder periods).

A week back I did my first show of the year - a dance show with a company that
I haven't worked with before, although thats not too suprising since they only
put a show on in alternate years.  This dance school was fun to work with -
well behaved, hard working and technically very good, however it was hard work
because the staging aspects - lighting and set requirements - were being
revealed to us as we went along.

However it was a good start to the year - next show is very different - *Up and
Under*, which will be far more of a straight comedy play, but is likely to be
quite creative in what they are doing.  I hope to get to one of their
rehearsals in the next week or so and get an idea of whats needed.
