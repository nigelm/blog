After a vastly long hiatus (the post 5 years back stating I intended to blog
more _really_ doesn't count), I've finally put something together.

Basically I have a batch of things I am trying out and so want to keep more
permanent notes on, hence bringing this back into play.


## Hosting

Previously I put content onto `wordpress.com` -- I certainly did not want to
get involved in actually managing the blogging platform.  However in the mean
time I have been using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for various thing, and it is
a much nicer system for me to work with, so moving to Hugo was an easy choice.

Additionally I can now use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host
the content (or various similar services).

The old Wordpress content was dumped as an XML export and converted to
Markdown as described in [Conversion tools from Wordpress to
Hugo](https://arjan.wooning.cz/conversion-tools-from-wordpress-to-hugo/#final-solution-exitwp-for-hugo)

The theme is [hugo-flex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-flex/)

Now all I need to do is write more content.
