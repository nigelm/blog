[Firefox](http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) has been crawling for me recently.  I mostly fixed this today by uninstalling [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/mac) from my [MacBook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/).

However I also fired up [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) - boy did it feel fast next to Firefox.  I really do like the cross browser sync features of [Google Browser Sync](http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/) which allows me to keep home and office in sync, and things like [Web Developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60) (which is only an occasional use, but invaluable), however Opera is a very nice browser.  Its a bit worrying to see all the stuff on pages I normally don't see - I normally always use [AdBlock](http://adblockplus.org/en/), but other than that Opera is under strong consideration.
