Somehow I have been absolutely snowed under for the last 2 months...  

The good bit is that I have the next 10 days on holiday - which means no blogging whatsoever (no change there then).  

Hopefully I should be able to actually write something when I get back, although I am starting off with the get in and running of a musical.
