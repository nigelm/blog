      <title>Relocation....</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m shunting this blog across to wordpress - mainly to be able to use some of the tools available, such as the blogging bundle in TextMate, to handle blog posts.
The main thing is that I have no intention of doing software maintenance on a blogging platform (unless I&amp;rsquo;m being paid for it), so I am sticking with a hosted platform.
You may also find that the theme and layout (assuming you are looking here rather than reading via RSS) may keep changing in the short term until I get to like one look.</description>

      <description>Hmm.. it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. A very long while in fact.
However I think I will resurrect this blog - I did wonder about quietly killing it and starting another rather than have the embarassment of an 18 month gap in posting, but I&amp;rsquo;ll live with that for now. We can at least see where it goes from here.</description>
