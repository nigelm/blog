      <description>In the UK we are getting to the end of the political conference season, with lots of people earnestly telling us their ideas for government which will be tossed aside as soon as the inconvenience of a poll can disposed of.
For me the problem is that I don&amp;rsquo;t want solutions as much as I want revenge.
Seriously, the people responsible for all bad decisions made, basically take no rap for the problems they cause.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of activity on Twitter this morning regarding Bletchley Park - the home of the wartime British decryption effort, and effectively the birthplace of modern computing. Have a look at http://savingbletchleypark.org/ for information.
Bletchley Park is decaying, and in danger of becoming unsustainable - meaning a good chunk of modern computing history will be lost to the world. The normal funding mechanisms (National Lottery etc) have declined to support Bletchley Park.</description>
