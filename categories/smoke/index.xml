      <description>Smoke is becoming very much a theme of this week&amp;rsquo;s production.
The strange thing about managing these show runs is the way the work pans out. Typically I am fairly busy during the build period, very very busy during the lighting and technical phases, busy during the rehearsal phase and then relatively lightly loaded during the actual performance run (obviously during the performance itself I have work to do but thats only half the evening, and the time before the performance is quite low impact for most shows).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m stage managing the musical version of The Railway Children this week. The producing company has seen fit to obtain 4 (really!) smoke machines (and a hazer).
Obviously with all this kit to play with - 2 of the smoke machines were big brutes with DMX interfaces - we needed to test them out. So I rigged one of the DMX controlled ones at the front of stage, set its address, isolated the fire alarm zones covering auditorium, stage, backstage and roof space.</description>
