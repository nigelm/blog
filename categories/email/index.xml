      <description>I pretty much live by email. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for around 25 years now, and have had good access to internet email for close on 20 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on open development mailing lists for all of that time, and have at times been receiving many hundreds (if not thousands) of messages a day.
I obviously don&amp;rsquo;t read all those messages - not in detail - and since I maintain a bunch of machines that send all sorts of general notification mail, much of it is glanced at (ie just look at sender and subject) and either ignored or deleted.</description>
