      <description>There has been a lot of activity on Twitter this morning regarding Bletchley Park - the home of the wartime British decryption effort, and effectively the birthplace of modern computing. Have a look at http://savingbletchleypark.org/ for information.
Bletchley Park is decaying, and in danger of becoming unsustainable - meaning a good chunk of modern computing history will be lost to the world. The normal funding mechanisms (National Lottery etc) have declined to support Bletchley Park.</description>

      <description>I pretty much live by email. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for around 25 years now, and have had good access to internet email for close on 20 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on open development mailing lists for all of that time, and have at times been receiving many hundreds (if not thousands) of messages a day.
I obviously don&amp;rsquo;t read all those messages - not in detail - and since I maintain a bunch of machines that send all sorts of general notification mail, much of it is glanced at (ie just look at sender and subject) and either ignored or deleted.</description>
