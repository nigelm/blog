    <p>So we finished the run of How To Succeed In Business&hellip; last night with a pretty good performance, followed by one of the best aided get-outs I have ever seen - we had a good sized bunch of people helping, cheerfully, get the set out, everything cleaned up, and finally repainting the stage floor - the stage surface is hardboard with normally a coat of graphite grey paint on it, if someone wishes it a different colour for a show we have to return it to normal afterwards.</p>
<p>The real shame is that, despite a stonking show, lots of energy and really good staging and set, the audiences were disappointing because (we believe) its not a well recognised show (despite being a real big one back in the 60&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>Afterwards we had a post show party - pie and peas.  And then I collapsed into bed, and still feel fairly zomby-like today.</p>
