    <p>I&rsquo;m back in theatre again - this time to stage manage a production of <a href="http://www.theatrehistory.com/american/musical018.html">How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</a>.  The <a href="http://nailing-jelly.blogspot.com/2007/05/of-bands-and-bums.html">bees</a> are also back.  There were many wandering around and dying on stage in the morning - then I found one on a cloth I was tying up to a flying bar (it didn&rsquo;t like being found and stung me).
Setting lights was a problem because the things are attracted to them when on - my colleague also picked up a sting then.
Later we rigged an insect killer up on a flying bar near the root - it appeared to be picking up a large number of victims.
These are supposed to be Masonry Bees - which apparently are unable to penetrate human skin.  However several of us were stung.  Hopefully the maintenance guys can do something about them after the weekend.</p>
